<h1>Version 1</h1>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The adventure is &#8220;Storm King&#8217;s Thunder&#8221;, a new adventure for characters level 1&#8211;12. Adventurers of all experience levels are welcome. The group size will be &gt;= 4 players.</p>

<p>As an adventurer, you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to buy anything. However, a good set of dice will always help! [0]</p>

<h1>Info</h1>

<ul>
<li>We will be using audio to communicate (webcams optional but recommended) over something like Skype or Discord.</li>
<li>We will play on https://roll20.net/, which is a virtual table top. In-person play will still be possible, though laptops will have to be shared (etc).</li>
<li>We will run a &#8220;session 0&#8221; to make sure we all know how to use roll20.net, and to introduce everyone&#8217;s characters.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Characters</h1>

<p>Character creation is easier than it sounds. For all adventurers, I will be more than happy to spend some time with you helping you figure out what kind of character you want to play, and get everything ready with you. For newbies, this will probably take 1&#8211;2 hours, because there will be more things to explain.</p>

<p>If you were part of the group that played &#8220;Lost Mine of Phandelver&#8221;, you can carry on using your character. However, you can retcon/change <em>any</em> aspect of your characters &#8211; including ability scores, skills, race, class, background information &#8211; now that you know more about them.</p>

<p>For veteran adventurers who want to dive straight in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Characters start at level 5.

<ul>
<li>Create a level 1 character, then progress through level-ups one at a time.</li>
<li>Initial ability scores are to be picked from: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please read the &#8220;game rules&#8221; section below for restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reiterate, I am happy to help everyone with this!</p>

<h1>Games rules</h1>

<ul>
<li>Characters must not of an Evil alignment.</li>
<li>Characters must not be any of the following races: Dragonborn, Duergar, Deep Gnome, Genasi, Aasimar.</li>
<li>Half-elf racial variants and/or Tiefling racial variants (as described in the &#8220;Sword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide&#8221; book) are not allowed.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Known unknowns</h1>

<ul>
<li>I like rolling real dice, so I am looking to see how we can do that and yet have it all work within roll20.net.</li>
<li>I am learning how to use roll20.net properly so I can teach everyone.</li>
</ul>
